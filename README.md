Build an application to book a flight: a user can enter a departure and an arrival location, the desired departure date and the number of people. After clicking on the search button you will get an overview of found flights. When the user selects a flight, the user can enter his data and the user gets an overview of the data.

The focus is on the flight search, the data may be mocked (JSON), or come from an API. Of course it doesn't have to work completely. (For example, only a limited number of destinations.)

The assignment must be made in one of the common front-end frameworks: React, Angular or Vue.

There are no requirements with regard to the look & feel.

You must submit the assignment in 2 ways

1. A link to the demo (Tip!: via Netlify you can use Hosting and CI/CD for free. Create an account and connect a git repo. Then a build is run every time you push to the repo)
2. A link to the repo so we can review your code and run the application ourselves to see how it works.
3. When submitting the assignment, state at least one search example that can be used to search in the application.

For clarity.
I specified a maximum number of hours to avoid getting excited and spent 40 hours on it. Less is of course also possible.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
